This small project started out as a challenge for myself to see how hard it would
be to create code that would create a visual respresentation of text using rectangles
in the game maker engine. A small game then arose from that.
Left and right arrows move between pages, and the objective is to open the paragraphs
and find the words listed on the paper next to the book. Both game objects can be dragged
around to adjust however one sees fit on the table.
